COMP 472 PROJECT

The models of this project were trained on Google colab. Therefore it is strongly recommended to run the notebooks on colab or Jupyter.

Models:
MLP- The base model MLP
MLP_V1 = MLP model with extra layers
MLP_V2= MLP model with less layers
MLP_V3= MLP model with less weights
MLP_V4 = MLP model with more weights

vgg11_base = VGG11 base model
vgg11_extralayer2 = VGG11 with 2 extra layers
vgg11_lesslayer2 = VGG11 with 2 less layers
vgg11_Kernel2 = VGG11 with kernel size 2
vg11_kernel5 = VGG11 with kernel size 5

Notebooks:
DataVisualization.ipynb = This notebook visualizes the data and it's distribution.
CNN_Notebook.ipynb = This notebook contains the code for preprocessing the dataset, training the base and 4 variations of VGG11 model. The notebook also displays the metric evaluations.
MLP_final.ipynb = This notebook contains the code for preprocessing the dataset, training the base and 4 variations MLP model. The notebook also displays the metric evaluations.

Python scripts:
CNN_script runs the CNN program with all the models
DataVisualization_script runs the Data Visualization program
MLP_scirpt runs the MLP program with all the models
